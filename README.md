# Broforce-Clone
A 2D replica of Broforce game made in Unity.

## Description
I have named it **Trying to be Broforce** as it is still under development. TTBB is classic arcade-style replica of brototype where players control a character and try to cross and complete
a level filled with interesting design and enemies. It has been developed for a Game Jam within 3 days using free assets available on the internet (Mostly assetstore.unity.com and kenney.nl).

## Future to-do Changes:
- Add a SoundManager to play Audio Effects and Music to the game.
- Currently only normal attack is available for player, have to add additional special attack.
- New characters to spawn on triggered by crates.
